  Hi! I'm Tiffany, and I'm a senior at the National University of Singapore, majoring in <b>Computer Science</b> with a minor in <b>Interactive Media Development</b>.

  <br />
  <br />

  Iâ€™m currently a <b>Product Design Intern with Grab</b>. I also have experience as a Product Designer and Software Engineer at a number of startups where I've always championed good user experiences, as well as being an <b>Undergrad Teaching Assistant for Interaction Design</b> in NUS.

  <br />
  <br />

  I'm currently looking for full-time design roles after graduating in December 2022.

  <br />
  <br />
  My design process is inspired by my background in both engineering
  and design, I love connecting the dots between business goals,
  technical constraints and user satisfaction. This year, my goal is to explore animation and motion design.
